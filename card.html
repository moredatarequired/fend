            <p class="description">These brown bats can be found throughout the western portion of North America, in pine forests ane arid scrub deserts where they almost always roost in caves. They favor moths but eat other insects such as beetles, flies and wasps. Their giant ears are used for echolocation, allowing them to "see" even in complete darkness.</p>
